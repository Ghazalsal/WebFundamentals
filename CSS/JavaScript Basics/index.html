        <h2>JavaScript Basics:</h2>
        <p>  is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
             JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them. </p>
                <p>• <a href="#">JavaScript</a>  JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. var x; Variable Assignment Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. var x = 10; 
                <p>• <a href="#">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean true or false; null null aka nothing; Number 42 or 3.14159; String - "Coding Dojo Rocks!"; Array [1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo']; and Object - {first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'} Conditionals When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. </p>  
                <p>There are the following conditional statements: if a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; else we execute this block of code; </p>
                <p>• <a href="#">Loops</a>Loops There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</p> 
                <p>• <a href="#">Functions</a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Thỉnk of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</p>
